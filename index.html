    <h1>To Make a Dadaist Poem</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Take a newspaper.</li>
      <li>Take a pair of scissors.</li>
      <li>Choose an article as long as you are planning to make your poem.</li>
      <li>Cut out the article.</li>
      <li>
        Then cut out each of the words that make up this article and put them in
        a bag.
      </li>
      <li>Shake it gently.</li>
      <li>
        Then take out the scraps one after the other in the order in which they
        left the bag.
      </li>
      <li>Copy conscientiously.</li>
      <li>The poem will be like you.</li>
      <li>
        And here are you a writer, infinitely original and endowed with a
        sensibility that is charming though beyond the understanding of the
        vulgar.
      </li>

      const article = `Today, more and more women are fighting this patriarchal straitjacket. For no more righteous reason than the fact our own experiences deny the stereotype. Women allies bring us too much joy to continuously classify them as opposition. Indeed, Pip and my other close girlfriends have been among the great, sweeping love affairs of my life. That women stand shoulder-to-shoulder and face-to-face is proof that romantic love is not the pinnacle. Female friendships are the foundation of who we are. A force for good in a world that feels messy, uncertain and scary so much of the time. women stand face-to-face in life, whereas men stand shoulder-to-shoulder against the world. She is right`;
